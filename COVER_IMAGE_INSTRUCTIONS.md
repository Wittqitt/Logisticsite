# How to Add the Cover Image

## Step 1: Save the Image
1. Right-click on the image you want to use (the produce/delivery truck image)
2. Select "Save Image As..." or "Save Picture As..."
3. Name it exactly: **`cover.jpg`**
4. Save it to this folder: **`assets/images/`**

## Step 2: Verify
After saving, you should have:
- `assets/images/cover.jpg` (your new cover image)
- `assets/images/cocoa.jpg`
- `assets/images/maize.jpg`
- `assets/images/warehouse.jpg`
- `assets/images/applogo.png`

## Step 3: Test
Open `index.html` in your browser to see the cover image as the hero background!

## Notes:
- The image should be a JPG file named exactly `cover.jpg`
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 pixels or larger for best quality
- The image will automatically resize and center on the page
- There's a dark overlay on top to ensure text readability
